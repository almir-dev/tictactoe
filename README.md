# This is an unfinished version for a multiplayer tic tac toe game.

The app support:
* editing user profile (username and avatar image)
* creating/deleting/joining(updating) games
* If used with 2 sessions (2 browsers for example), 1 player can create a game, and the 2nd player can join the game
* multiplayer feature is pretty much garbage, just added a simple polling to see if a player has joined, in a similiar fashion the game should be played, but that is not yet implemented


# How to use app
The user has to first register/login in the upper right corner, after successfully logging in, in the app bar he can edit his profile and logout.
Once logged in the user should have access to the dashboard page (visible in the app bar), there he can create/delete/join games.
